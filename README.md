# WeRateDogs_Wrangle_and_Analyze
Data wrangling with Python

## Project Overview
Real-word data rarely comes clean, especially if data comes from a variety of sources and formats. For this project, I am analyzing the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as “WeRateDogs”. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. For this project, I’ve used Python and its libraries in order to retrieve, clean, visualize data and draw meaningful conclusions. The purpose of this project is to gather data from a variety of sources and variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, clean it (this is called data wrangling), and finally stored cleaned data, create visualizations and draw conclusions in the meaningful report.

## Data Wrangling

A comprehensive report about data wrangling and its steps is saved in a pdf file and can be found on the following link: [Data Wrangling - Report](wrangle_report.pdf)

## Communicating Findings

Finding and visualizations that were created from cleaned datasets are saved in pdf file. The file can be found on the following link [Findings and Visualizations - Report](act_report.pdf)

***For this project I am using the following:***

- pandas
- NumPy
- requests
- tweepy
- json
- matplotlib & seaborn

***Data is gather from different sources and formats:***

- Tweeter API
